# Pelli.com React Frontend

This folder contains a small Vite + React conversion of your existing static frontend HTML pages.

How to run
1. cd into this folder:

   cd frontend/react-app

2. Install dependencies and run dev server:

   npm install
   npm run dev

Notes
- This is a minimal conversion that mirrors the original HTML pages as React routes.
- Backend endpoints are assumed to be available at http://localhost:5000 (same as your original code.)
